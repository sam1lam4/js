> sam1 lam4 : _forest_ [Cantonese, using the Jyutping notation]

Collection of tools to use with ASTs (Abstract Syntax Trees), in order to extract useful information from them or to manipulate them to generate new code.

## Usage

This is still in an initial stage, so please expect the API of the package and the cli to be updated with breaking changes. Currently it requires Node v6 or above. Run `sam1lam4 --help` to get started.

## Autocompletion

It will autocomplete the action with the relative files and with the builtin actions that come with the package. To use it, add this to your `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile` or similar:
```sh
eval "$(sam1lam4 _get_bash_completion)"
```
