Collection of tools to use with ASTs (Abstract Syntax Trees), in order to extract useful information from them or to manipulate them to generate new code.

## Usage

This is still in an initial stage, so please expect the API of the package and the cli to be updated with breaking changes. Currently it requires Node v6. Soon it will include an autocompletion script to suggest the existing scripts, although you can also create custom scripts.
